# EENG348_Project_1
Assembly and Arduino


Please do not copy this code if you are in our class! We will find you.


This code is for EE348, digital systems. Several of the class assignments are labs, which involve programming an arduino to accomplish a specific task / set of tasks.

This particular assignment involved relatively elementary assembly programming, which included, but was not limited to: AVR ISA, callee vs. caller convention, procedural calls, recursion, and comparative statements. Sketch (specifically, the assembly in the function testasm) 1 and 2 run in O(1) time.

Sketch 3 (iterative) runs in O(n) time.

Sketch 3 (recursive) runs in O(2^n) time.
